<h2 class="fat-bottom">Research</h2>

<p><em>The following is a brief description of his research interests.</em></p>

<p>A quote attributed to the late John Reynolds states: "Semanticists should be the obstetricians of programming languages, 
not the coroners." This sentiment resonates deeply with me as a computer scientist drawn to the theory of programming 
languages. It reflects the aspiration to uncover the fundamental structures underlying computation and to use that understanding 
to guide the design of new languages or improve existing ones.</p>

<p class="indentfirst">From early in my career, my interests have extended beyond structural aspects to include the study 
of program efficiency. More broadly, it is well known that the study of computational phenomena can be approached 
through quantitative techniques, which allow us to capture dimensions not purely logical in natureâ€”for example, the 
degree of correctness of randomized programs or the analysis of errors in numerical algorithms. As a matter of fact, 
accurately predicting the behavior of a rapidly growing portion of modern software requires such techniques.</p>

<p class="indentfirst">How can these two perspectives be brought together? How can we interpret programs within 
mathematical frameworks that naturally and faithfully capture quantitative properties, without sacrificing simplicity 
and compositionality? These questions lie at the heart of my current research and, in various forms, have shaped much of 
my work in recent years.</p>
