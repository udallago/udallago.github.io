<h2>Research</h2>

A quote attributed to John Reynolds states: "Semanticists should be the obstetricians of programming languages, not the coroners." This sentiment resonates deeply with me as a computer scientist drawn to the theory of programming languages. It reflects the aspiration to uncover the fundamental structures underlying computation and to use that understanding to guide the design of new languages or improve existing ones.<br>

From early in my career, my interests have extended beyond structural aspects to include the study of program efficiency. More broadly, it is well known that computation can be approached through quantitative techniques, which allow us to capture dimensions not purely logical in natureâ€”for example, the probabilistic correctness of randomized programs or the analysis of errors in numerical algorithms.<br>

How can these two perspectives be brought together? How can we interpret programs within mathematical frameworks that naturally and faithfully capture quantitative properties, without sacrificing simplicity or compositionality? These questions lie at the heart of my current research and, in various forms, have shaped much of my work in recent years.
