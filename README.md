<p class="indentfirst">Ugo Dal Lago has been professor of Computer Science at the University of Bologna since November 2015. The purpose of this web page is to describe his research and teaching activity.</p>

<p class="indentfirst">Dal Lago's research interests are varied, and focus on theoretical computer science. Since his PhD studies, he have been interested in programming language theory and in particular in the more quantitative aspects of the latter. As an example, he studied and developed semi-automatic complexity analysis techniques for functional programs, but also the problem of attributing a meaning to programs in such a way as to justify approximate reasoning and support assessments of accuracy.</p>

<p class="indentfirst">For some time now he as also been interested in understanding the nature of computational models other than the classical one and the impact that such paradigms can have on the theory and practice of programming. This includes randomized, Bayesian and quantum computing.</p>
