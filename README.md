<p>Ugo Dal Lago has been a professor of Computer Science at the University of Bologna since November 2015. He is also affiliated with INRIA Sophia Antipolis. The purpose of this web page is to describe his research and teaching activities.</p>

<p class="indentfirst">Dal Lago's research interests vary, focusing on theoretical computer science. Since his PhD studies, he has been interested in programming language theory, particularly in the more quantitative aspects of the latter. As an example, he studied and developed semi-automatic complexity analysis techniques for functional programs, but also the problem of attributing meaning to programs in such a way as to justify approximate reasoning.</p>

<p class="indentfirst">For some time now, he has also been interested in understanding the nature of computational models other than classical ones and the impact such paradigms can have on the theory and practice of programming. This includes randomized, Bayesian, and quantum computing.</p>
